# Buck_converter_design
Guided design of a Buck SMPS for the EE-365 Power Electronics course at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL). The principle tasks completed for the project include: 
  - design of power circuit based on provided design specifications 
  - selection of heat-sinks (if required) for power circuit semi-conductor components based on operating conditions 
  - selection of main control circuit components (PWM controller, auxiliary power supply, etc. from list of recommended alternatives)
  - design of passive control circuit based on Application Notes for main components
  - design of inductor based on available cores 
  - efficiency/loss analysis
  - schematic layout (in Altium)
  - PCB layout (in Altium)
